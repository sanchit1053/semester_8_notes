an empirical (measurement based) analysis is needed for?
- estabilish motivation
- correctness

meta print/ send of all experiments,  
no question => no experiments
- Q: question (why am I doing the experiments)
- A: accurate (only conclude what is "research")
- R: reproducable (redone and verified)
- C: complete (cover the entire parameter space)

1. Questions
2. Setup
3. Execution
    a. modality
    b. types
    c. instrumentations
4. Observation and inferences

## Questions
- correctness
- scalablilty (saturation behaviour)
- failure cause analysis
- comparitive analysis
- hypothesis testing

## Setup
- Configuration Settings
    * hardware
    * software
    * workload


1. Representative 
    - as closesely shoudl mimic real conditions
    - explicitily state deviations/ approximations 
2. workloads
    - need specifications
    - synthetic / micro benchmarking
